# Miniboss

Will try to build a mobile app to round up and improve my overall skills and understanding of front-end, back-end, databases and API's as well as learning about mobile deployment. The idea is to deploy a simple PWA whose purpose is to help fast-food/restaurant employees solve their questions related to the numerous tasks they perform everyday.

The front-end will consist of a home page with different important topics related to both front and back of house duties on a restaurant. The user will have access to all sorts of information whether it be recipes, health and safety regulations and company/restaurant information.

The back-end should be able to manage the different routes the data will have for each topic. It should be clear and structured by grouping the information into relevant tables and making the necessary arrangements so that data can be fetched from a PostgreSQL database. 

# Milestones:
- Implemented a functional React Router sorting the different pages of the app.
